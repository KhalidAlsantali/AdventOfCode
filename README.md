# Advent of Code
This is a repository of my solutions to the Advent of Code event. An annual event of 25 daily themed programming puzzles.

# How to run

Build using ```make``` and run the output files. You can also use ```.\runAllSolutions.ps1``` or ```./runAllSolutions.sh``` in years that include them.
