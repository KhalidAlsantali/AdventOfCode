# Advent of Code
This is a repository of my solutions to the Advent of Code event. An annual event of 25 daily themed programming puzzles.

# How to run

Build using ```make``` and run the output files. You can also use the Powershell script to run all solutions.

```
.\runallsolutions.ps1       # Shows menu
.\runallsolutions.ps1 2024  # Runs all 2024 solutions
.\runallsolutions.ps1 all   # Runs all solutions
```
